Refactoring a Weather Forecast Application into Classes and Modules

The aim of this assignment is to refactor an existing Python script for a weather forecast application into a more structured, object-oriented, and modular format. The focus will be on identifying parts of the script that can be encapsulated into classes and organizing these classes into appropriate modules to enhance code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

The existing script for the weather forecast application is written in a procedural style and lacks organization.

Run main.py to run the program.
